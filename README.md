# Movies and TV Shows Dataset Cleaning & Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about various movies and TV shows. The dataset includes several columns such as 'Movies', 'Year', 'Genre', 'Rating', 'One-Line', 'Stars', 'Votes', 'RunTime', and 'Gross'. The data is cleaned and processed to derive insights and patterns from the entertainment industry.

## Dataset Description
- **Movies**: Name of the Movie/TV Show.
- **Year**: Year of the release.
- **Genre**: Genre of the Movie/Show.
- **Rating**: Movie/Show Rating.
- **One-Line**: Concise description or summary of the Movie/Show.
- **Stars**: Contains information about the cast members and, in some cases, details about directors.
- **Votes**: Total number of votes received for the Movie/Show.
- **RunTime**: Duration or runtime of the Movie/Show.
- **Gross**: Total Amount earned Worldwide.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values in columns where applicable.
- **Parsing Year and Runtime**: Extracted and converted year and runtime information into appropriate formats for analysis.
- **Cleaning 'Stars' Column**: Extracted cast member names and handled cases with additional director information.

## Conclusion
Cleaning a dataset can be a tedious job. It requires proper logic inorder to not waste much time. The key is to identify patterns and eliminate garbage from the root. 

## Future Work
Potential future work might include:
- Sentiment analysis on one-liner descriptions.
- Machine learning models for predicting ratings or earnings based on available features.
- Incorporating additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

*Note: This project is aimed at demonstrating data cleaning & analysis skills and drawing insights from the provided dataset of movies and TV shows.*
